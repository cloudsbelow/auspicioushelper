Well it's actually usable now! Will try not to brick your machine <3
Assembly references are not supported (except for stuff in the interop folder.) If there is something you want me to add interop functionality to, just ask, BUT ANY NON INTEROP PUBLIC FIELDS ARE LIABLE TO CHANGE.

Todo:

 - Portal staticmover enable/disable stuff
 - Cassette gate
 - Debris accellerator
 - Secret <3

 Potential performance/cleanup things:
  - MipGrid cache cleanup?
